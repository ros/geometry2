<description brief="Bullet Physics Engine">
    <p>
    This package contains version 2.76 of the Bullet professional
    free 3D Game Multiphysics Library.  The ROS package automatically
    downloads, extracts and compiles a tarball.  For each major
    release of the Bullet library, the tarball will get updated.  The
    Bullet library provided by this ROS package is slightly different
    from the official Bullet release.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    To eliminate ambiguity about which API is active the btQuaternion
    constructor from Euler angles is deprecated. Please explicitly 
    construct it and populate it seperately from euler angles, 
    otherwise it is ambiguous
    as to what convention is being used.  
    </li>
    <li>
    The btMatrix3x3 and btQuaternion setEulerZYX and getEulerZYX
    methods are deprecated.  The goal of these deprecations is to
    remove the existing patch against Bullet which makes them
    consistent.  They will be deprecated for a few releases, then
    patched out for a few releases before being reintroduced in their
    native form.  setEulerYPR and getEulerYPR are drop in replacements.
    Also available is getRPY setRPY which use fixed axis notation about
    XYZ axes.  
    </li>
    <li>
    There are a few errors in documentation and
    btMatrix3x3::getEulerYPR has been changed to be a pass through to
    getEulerZYX for it is a better implementation of the same method.
    These are filed under 
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/detail?id=282">issue 282</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
    For standardization and continuity Fixed Axis getRPY and setRPY
    methods have been added to btQuaternion and btMatrix3x3.  These
    will be pushed back to Bullet, and hopefully accepted.  These are
    the same format as used by kdl and gazebo. Standardization survey
    and decision at
    <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/tf/Reviews/Euler_Angle_Usage_2009-09-02_API_Review">on
    the ROS wiki</a>.  These patches have been pushed back
    in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/detail?id=285">issue
    285</a> This patch will be maintained in parallel if Bullet does
    not accept it.
    </li>
    <li>
    There is a patch against the btQuaternion angle and getAngle
    methods to clamp floating point errors to prevent nan results.
    See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/detail?id=98">issue 98</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
    We have the intention to move towards the official version of
    Bullet; this however will take some time because it involves a
    number of deprecation cycles for the conflicting quaternion
    constructor.
    </li>
    <li>
      This usage of bullet compiles with the flags
      -DBT_USE_DOUBLE_PRECISION -DBT_EULER_DEFAULT_ZYX set.
    </li>
    </ul>
